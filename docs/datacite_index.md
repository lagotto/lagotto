## DataCite Event Data

The DataCite Event Data service collects events around DataCite DOIs. The events are found via the **relatedIdentifier** and **nameIdentifier** attributes of DataCite Metadata, and via external services (so-called sources) that collect information about DataCite DOIs.

Examples of events include references to related data, data citations in journal articles, and new versions of a work.

Event Data is a backend service, the data are made available via the [DataCite API](https://api.datacite.org) and via [DataCite Search](https://search.datacite.org). Please contact [DataCite staff](mailto:support@datacite.org) for more information.
