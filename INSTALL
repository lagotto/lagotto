Installation on CentOS
======================

Goals
-----

  - Install Ruby Enterprise Edition, a version of Ruby optimized for web
    applications. 
  - Install & configure Passenger, aka "mod_rails" - an Apache plugin that runs
    our application.
  - Install Starling, a message-queue daemon that uses Memcached's API, and
    Workling, a client daemon that handles messages as requests to requery
    sources for article data.
  - Install the Ruby "gems" (library packages) that the Article-Level Metrics
    application requires.
  - Install the Article-Level Metrics application itself using Capistrano.

Ruby Enterprise Edition can be downloaded from
<http://www.rubyenterpriseedition.com/download.html>. Use the current
version. It installs into a self-contained folder. We'll also configure
Apache to use it when running our application.

Rails applications run in a specific "environment": "development" by default,
or "test" or "production" as defined by a setting in the environment or Apache
configuration. Each environment has its own set of configuration settings,
database & log (so you can run different environments on the same machine out
of the same source tree if you want).

Walkthrough
-----------

Prerequisites

    # I'll need to be root for a few of these initial steps
    su - root

    # Install some dependencies
    yum install gcc-c++ httpd httpd-devel libtool libxml2-devel mysql-server openssh openssl-devel readline-devel subversion zlib-devel mysql-devel

    # Make sure MySQL and Apache run at startup
    /sbin/chkconfig mysqld on
    /sbin/chkconfig httpd on

    # Create the alm user and application directory structure.
    useradd -d /opt/alm -m -r alm

    # Download Ruby Enterprise Edition from <http://www.rubyenterpriseedition.com/download.html>
    wget http://rubyforge.org/frs/download.php/71096/ruby-enterprise-XXX.tar.gz
    tar xzf ruby-enterprise-XXX.tar.gz

    # Build and install Ruby Enterprise Edition. Near the end of this, look for
    # a couple of warnings about postgresql and sqlite - you can ignore them,
    # but if it also warns you about mysql, something's missing related to the
    # mysql libraries...
    ruby-enterprise-XXX/installer -a /opt/ree/XXX

    # Make a symlink to refer to the current Ruby Enterprise Edition; remove
    # any existing one first (so it doesn't get followed)
    ln -s /opt/ree/XXX /opt/ree/current

    # Add Ruby Enterprise Edition to the path. Put this into
    # /etc/profile.d/ruby.sh to make it happen in future sessions too.
    export PATH=/opt/ree/current/bin:$PATH
    # Double-check that the `ruby` and `gem` commands are available
    which ruby
    which gem

    # Install the Ruby "gem" (library) bundler that the ALM application needs.
    # This gem manages installing and managing other gems that the application
    # depends upon.
    gem install bundler
 
    # And install some other gems that bundler misses right now
    gem install starling
    gem install workling

    # Build & install Passenger (aka mod_rails). This will produce
    # some configuration lines for Apache - copy them.
    passenger-install-apache2-module

Apache configuration

    # Create a configuration file for Apache that will load Passenger 
    # and configure our application:
    vi /etc/httpd/conf.d/alm.conf
    # Paste in the lines produced by passenger-install-apache2-module
    # Along with the other Passenger settings, include these:

    # Keep idle application processes running a long time
    # (With the next Passenger version, this can be 0 for "forever";
    # 36000 seconds is 10 hours.)
    LoadModule passenger_module /opt/ree/current/lib/ruby/gems/1.8/gems/passenger-YYY/ext/apache2/mod_passenger.so
    PassengerRoot /opt/ree/current/lib/ruby/gems/1.8/gems/passenger-YYY
    PassengerRuby /opt/ree/current/bin/ruby
    PassengerPoolIdleTime 36000
    PassengerAllowEncodedSlashes on

    # Then, append all of this and fix the domain names in it:
    <VirtualHost *:80>
        ServerName alm.example.org
        ServerAdmin webmaster@example.org

        LogLevel warn
        ErrorLog /var/log/httpd/alm-error_log
        CustomLog /var/log/httpd/alm-access_log combined

        DocumentRoot /opt/alm/current/public

        # Important for ALM: keeps Apache from messing up encoded 
        # embedded slashes in DOIs
        AllowEncodedSlashes On

        # Deflate
        AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE text/html text/plain text/css text/xml application/xml application/xhtml+xml text/javascript

Deploy

    # If you are using capistrano, stop reading here and switch to the 
    # CAPISTRANO documentation file

    # check out the sources into /opt/alm/r1234 (depending on the revision number, 
    # or you can use any other directory name that makes sense)
    svn co http://svn.ambraproject.org/plos/alm/head /opt/alm/r1234

    # Create the current symlink and set ownership
    ln -s /opt/alm/r1234 /opt/alm/current
    chown -R alm.alm /opt/alm/r1234
    chmod -R g+w /opt/alm/r1234

    # Create config files
    mkdir /opt/alm/shared
    cp /opt/alm/current/config/database.yml.example /opt/alm/shared/database.yml
    cp /opt/alm/current/config/settings.yml.example /opt/alm/shared/settings.yml
    ln -s /opt/alm/shared/database.yml /opt/alm/current/config/
    ln -s /opt/alm/shared/settings.yml /opt/alm/current/config/
    # Edit the config files as necessary
    chown -R alm.alm /opt/alm/shared

    # Set up the database
    RAILS_ENV=production rake db:setup

    # install gems
    cd /opt/alm/current; bundle install

Post-Install

    # If you used capistrano to deploy, here's where you come back in

    # Set up Starling, the background message queue daemon, and
    # Workling, the handler for background messages; make sure we start them at
    # boot time.
    useradd -rs /sbin/nologin starling
    mkdir -p /var/{log,run,spool}/starling /var/run/workling
    chown starling:starling /var/{log,run,spool}/starling

    # We've included init files for starling and workling in the application's 
    # initscripts directory; symlink them into /etc/init.d, so they'll always
    # be the versions from subversion.
    ln -sf /opt/alm/current/initscripts/starling /etc/init.d/starling
    ln -sf /opt/alm/current/initscripts/workling /etc/init.d/workling

    # Make sure we start starling and workling at boot time
    /sbin/chkconfig starling on
    /sbin/chkconfig workling on

    # Add logs to logrotated:
    # /opt/alm/current/log/{*.log,workling.*}

Updating the ALM application

    # Check out the new sources
    # Update the current symlink
    # Run rake db:migrate
    # let passenger know that the code is ready to go
    touch /opt/alm/current/tmp/restart.txt
    # workling and starling

Updating REE

    # If you're installing a new Ruby Enterprise Edition, download it, expand it,
    # and install it in a date-named directory, then switch the symlink.
    wget http://url/from/download/page/ruby-enterprise-1.8.x-2009xxxx.tar.gz
    tar xzf ruby-enterprise-x.x.x-YYYYMMDD.tar.gz
    ruby-enterprise-x.x.x-YYYYMMDD/installer -a /opt/ree/XXX
    rm -f /opt/ree/current
    ln -s /opt/ree/XXX /opt/ree/current

    A new REE means you'll also have to
    - re-run `passenger-install-apache2-module`
    - reinstall the bundler gem

    A new Passenger version means you'll have to
    - re-run `passenger-install-apache2-module`
